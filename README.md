# SFML Projects

While the SFML forum provides a section for [projects](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?board=10.0), it happens too often that nice projects get lost in the depth of that sub-forum or that the archive with the game gets deleted. With the [SFML Projects](http://www.sfmlprojects.org/) website we want to provide a platform to host, share and archive projects that were made with or for [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).
